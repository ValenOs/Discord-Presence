# Discord-Presence
Discord Presence 

	To create a windows app head to https://discord.com/developers/applications
	
	To run the app that's compressed inside of a .rar go to @RichPresence\RichPresence\bin\Debug\README.txt

	I want clear out that by no means this is professional work. I just wanted to publish this really small project to help people that maybe are new
	to C# and were intrested in making an app that let them change their discord presence state. There are a thousand ways to make this app with better
	practices than mine.

	This program has been made with the help of DiscordRichPresence and Newtonsoft.Json.
